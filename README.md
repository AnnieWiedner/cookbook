# Project3

Cookbook App - third project for WDI at GA


## User Stories

 * The user must be registered and logged in in order to use the app
 * When the user logs in with the appropriate login information, they are directed to their homepage
 	* contains all of the recipe images/titles uploaded by the user
 	* allows the user to add additional recipes
 * The user can click any recipe to view full instrucions

## Wireframes

I will upload these over the weekend

## Technologies Used

* AngularJS
* Ruby
* ActiveRecord
* SQL

## What is unfinished?
(current as of Friday morning 7/28)
* Background images and additional styling needs to be added to the Details and List Components
* User cannot edit their recipe once it is added

## What would I like to expand on? 
* Add an explore page to view all users' receipes
* Make instructions easier to add (maybe separate that into its own SQL table that belongs_to a specific recipe)
* Allow users to comment on recipes
* Add catagorization for user's recipes (ex. desserts, entrees, appetizers)
